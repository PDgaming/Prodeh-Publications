# Entities:
## The Power System:
- **Scientific Name:** **Soma-Manifestations**.
- **Public/Underground Name:** **Anomalies**.
- **Official Legal Term:** **Abilities**.
- **Nature:** Rare, genetic mutations that grant unique powers.
- **The Hierarchy of Origin:**
    1. **Natural Soma-Manifestations:** Individuals born with these traits. They manifest typically during puberty, extreme stress, or trauma. These are considered inherently stronger and more potent. But sometimes they can remain dormant until triggered by an external force.
    2. **Bio-Enhanced/Artificial Abilities:** Created by World Government scientists (Bio-Enhancement Division). They involve activating latent genes (Robert’s case) or attempting to replicate powers artificially (often weaker or unstable).
- **Robert’s Power:** **Super Strength**.
    - **Origin**: Robert possessed a latent Soma-Manifestation at birth (explaining his natural aptitude as a hitman). During his service to the World Government, scientists activated and significantly enhancedthis gene, granting him "OP" levels of strength.

## The World Government (WG):
### Structure & Nature:
- **Name:** **The World Government (WG)**.
- **Ideology:** Inspired by Nazism/Totalitarianism. They preach "World Harmony" and order while secretly conducting unethical human experimentation to weaponize evolution. They view Natural Anomalies as "deviants" to be controlled or purged.
- **Public Presence:** In Part 1, they are a background entity. Their oppression is felt through strict laws, resource control, and propaganda, but their true scope is hidden from the average citizen until later.
### Military Hierarchy:
1. **The World Defense Force (WDF):**
    - **Role**: The conventional military and police. Widespread and visible.
    - **Duties**: Manning checkpoints, quelling civil unrest, resource allocation, and low-level containment.
    - **Composition**: Non-powered humans with standard to advanced weaponry.
2. **The Censors:**
    - **Role**: The elite, high-authority enforcers. They operate with impunity above the law to suppress revolutions and hunt high-level Anomalies.
    - **Composition**: A mix of Natural Soma-Manifestations (coerced or loyal) and WG-Enhanced Individuals.
    - **Global Reach**: Stationed in key sectors to ensure global control.
    - **Robert’s Connection**: Robert was formerly coerced/recruited to be a Censor before his retirement.

## The Nightfall:
### Leadership & Base:
- **Leader:** Elias Thorne (Codename: Zero).
    - **Background**: An ex-World Government insider/scientist/strategist. He defected after witnessing the horrors of the bio-enhancement programs. He possesses deep knowledge of WG algorithms and secrets.
    - **Relationship to Robert**: He tracked Robert down when no one else could and offered him a path to atonement.
- **Headquarters:** "Winter’s Edge".
    - **Location**: Buried deep within the snowy mountains of **Canada**.
    - **Security**: Natural camouflage (blizzards) and magnetic interference that blinds WG scanners/drones.
    - **Facilities**: Living quarters for refugees, medical wings for injured Anomalies, and a War Room.
### Structure & Operations:
- **Organization Style:** Decentralized Cell System. Independent bases operate globally to prevent the WG from destroying the whole group if one cell is captured.
- **Communication:** "The Echo Network". Uses analog tech (shortwave radios), unbreakable shifting codes, and "Runners" to physically carry data, bypassing WG surveillance.
	- **Cell Roles:** Different bases could specialize:
	    - **The Archives (Europe):** Focus on information gathering and hacking WG propaganda.
	    - **The Forge (Russia/Asia):** Focus on weapons manufacturing and supply lines.
	    - **The Sanctuary (South America):** A hiding place for refugees and low-level Anomalies.
	    - **The Spear (Canada - Robert's Group):** The strike team. The ones who handle the heavy combat missions.
