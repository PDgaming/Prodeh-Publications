********## **David Graham (53, High School English Teacher):**

- ### **Early Life & Childhood:**
    - Grew up in a small, quiet town in Upstate New York, not too far from Rochester. A stable, middle-class upbringing, but a loving family.
    - Was a thoughtful, somewhat introverted child. Always loved reading; excelled in English classes.
    - Had a close relationship with his mother, who encouraged his love of literature. Father was a practical, hardworking man who perhaps didn't quite "get" David's passion for books.
- ### **Teenage Years:**
    - Quietly rebellious. While still focused on academics, he developed a cynical streak and questioned authority.
    - Found solace in literature, particularly works that explored themes of loss, isolation, and societal injustice.
    - Secretly wrote poetry and short stories, filled with angst and disillusionment, that he never shared with anyone.
- ### **Young Adulthood & Career:**
    - Attended a state university, majoring in English Literature.
    - Became a high school teacher because he genuinely wanted to share his love of reading and writing with young people.
    - Has been teaching at the same high school in Rochester for nearly 30 years. Well-respected by his colleagues and students, but perhaps a little stuck in his ways.
- ### **Later Life:**
    - Wife died of a disease. Has a comfortable, but somewhat lonely life without his wife. Since her death, he has become a very loving and understanding man who has a lot of empathy for others and understands others' pain.
    - Spends his free time reading, going to the occasional play.
