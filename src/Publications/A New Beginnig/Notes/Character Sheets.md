## **David Graham**
David is a 53 year old High school English Teacher.
### Early Life & Childhood:
- David Grew up in a small, quiet town in Upstate New York, not too far from Rochester. A stable, middle-class upbringing, but a loving family.
- Was a thoughtful, somewhat introverted child. Always loved reading; excelled in literature classes.
- Had a close relationship with his mother, who encouraged his love of literature. Father was a practical, hardworking man who perhaps didn't quite "get" David's passion for books.
### Teenage Years:
- Quietly rebellious. While still focused on academics, he developed a cynical streak and questioned authority.
- Found solace in literature, particularly works that explored themes of loss, isolation, and societal injustice.
- Secretly wrote poetry and short stories, filled with angst and disillusionment, that he never shared with anyone.
### Young Adulthood & Career:
- Attended a state university, majoring in English Literature.
- Became a high school teacher because he genuinely wanted to share his love of reading and writing with young people.
- Has been teaching at the same high school in Rochester for nearly 30 years. Well-respected by his colleagues and students, but perhaps a little stuck in his ways.
### Later Life:
- Wife died of a disease(HCL, a rare form of luekemia). Has a comfortable, but somewhat lonely life without his wife. Since her death, he has become a very loving and understanding man who has a lot of empathy for others and understands others' pain.
- Spends his free time reading, going to the occasional play.

### **Young Adulthood & Career:**
- Attended Harvard, majoring in Computer Science.
- Joined a Software Firm.
- Worked as a Software Engineer for 12 years.
### Criminal background:
- Accidentally killed a man one day. Decided that he liked killing people.
- Quit his job and became a serial killer, and started killing more and more people.
- Eventually started working with the mafia as a hit men to eliminate targets.
- Someone ratted him out to agents of a secret government agency that researched for creating powerful military weapons.
- Did experiments on his for 5 years, turning him into a soulless monster for doing their bidding.
- Triggered his by-birth power of Super Strength.
- The higher ups heard about him and offered him to join the Enforcers and work for the government.
- Robert agreed at first, did their work.
- But soon Robert got sick of authority, escaped and went into hiding.
### Entry to The Nightfall:
- Zero (ex-World Government Insider) tracked him down. Zero doesn't appeal to Robert's morality (which Robert thinks he lost long ago), but to his **atonement**. Zero offers him a way to dismantle the very labs that made him a monster.
- Robert accepts, becoming Nightfall’s "Ace in the Hole." 
- Robert was a surgical weapon. Because of his Super Strength and assassin skills, he was sent on impossible extractions.
- He became a legend within Nightfall. The younger members didn't know his face, but they knew of "The Breaker", the man who could walk through reinforced steel walls and vanish before the dust settled.
- After 4 years of brutality, Robert started getting weary. Zero saw this and reassigned him to Winter's Edge (Canada HQ) to train a new generation.
- He was given a small squad of young, natural Anomalies. Let's call them "Unit Echo." These were kids with powerful but unstable abilities who had no control.
- Robert was a hard teacher, but protective. He tried to teach them discipline and control, desperately wanting to save them from becoming weapons like him. He started to feel something akin to fatherhood.
- Unit Echo was sent on a "routine" reconnaissance mission near the border. It was supposed to be safe. Robert went as supervision.
- They were ambushed by a Censor.
- The Censor threatened the kids. Robert, desperate to protect them, snapped. He unleashed his Super Strength without any restraint. He went full "monster."
- In his blind rage, Robert destroyed the Censor's forces, but his power was too uncontrolled. He caused a massive structural collapse.
- While he killed the enemy, two of his own students died in the collateral damage. He couldn't save them from the destruction he caused.
- Robert blamed himself entirely. He realized that his "protection" was just as dangerous as the WG's attacks. He looked at his hands and saw only death.
### Later Life:
- Robert told Zero he was done. He couldn't teach, he couldn't fight. He was a danger to everyone he cared about.
- He moved to Rochester; a quiet place, far away from the snowy memories of Canada, to rot away in obscurity.
- Then he met David. David was the opposite of Nightfall. He was safe, gentle, and had nothing to do with powers or war. David was Robert's second chance at being a human being, not a weapon.
