## The Main Storyline
### Part 1: The Quiet Life (David’s POV)

- **The Threat:** The "Letter" arrives from Nightfall. Robert plays it off, but tension rises.
- **The Confrontation:** A Nightfall runner arrives at David’s door. Robert goes into "Censor Mode" (protective/lethal posture). David realizes Robert is hiding a massive secret.
- **The Partial Truth:** Robert confesses he was a "bad man" (implies organized crime/hitman, omits the Superpowers/WG). He says he is being called back.

### Part 2: The New World (Transition & Building Tension)

- **The Double Life:** Robert returns to Nightfall as a strategist/consultant. David continues teaching locally but helps heal injured "Anomalies" brought to their safe house.
- **The Cracks Form:** David witnesses Robert beating up a spy. He sees the "Monster."
- **The Wedding (The Turning Point):**
    - The Setup: Robert hears friends mocking David ("Why are you with him?"). Robert, masking, agrees and insults David to fit in. David hears it.
    - The Confrontation: In the hotel room, David confronts him. Robert, unable to process shame, snaps.
    - The Abuse: Robert uses his size and voice to terrorize David (verbal abuse, gaslighting, smashing furniture). He almost hits David but stops.
    - The Aftermath: Robert switches to "caretaker" mode, love-bombing David. David, traumatized but loving him, forgives him. The dynamic shifts: Robert is now the volatile protector; David is the enduring anchor.

- **The Death:** David refuses to leave Robert’s side. In a cruel twist, the High Censor targets David to unbalance Robert. **David is killed instantly.**
- **The Berserker:** Robert goes insane. He ignores all defense and attacks with pure grief. He is beaten within an inch of his life.
- **The Defeat:** Zero and The Spear intervene to drag Robert’s unconscious body away. They retreat, leaving David’s body behind. The base is lost.
### **Part 4: The Return (Vengeance & Revolution)**
- **The Time Skip (2 Years):** Robert has been living in isolation in the tundra, mourning. He is a ghost of a man.
- **The Catalyst:** News reaches him that the High Censor who killed David has captured Zero.
- **The Awakening:** Robert realizes his "Enhanced" strength was limited by his human mind. He embraces the monster fully, training to break his limiters.
- **The Rescue:** A heist-style mission. Robert infiltrates the WG prison. We see his new brutality—he is cold, efficient, and unstoppable.
- **The War:** Nightfall launches a total assault on the WG Northern Command.
- **The Duel:** Robert vs. The High Censor (Round 2).
    - The Outcome: It isn't close. Robert doesn't fight with anger; he fights with cold, dead precision. He obliterates the Censor (10-nil victory). He avenges David.
### **Part 5: Atonement (Endgame)**
- **The Fall of the WG:** With the Northern Command broken and the Censors defeated, the global revolution succeeds. The World Government is dismantled.
- **The New World:** Peace begins to return. The "Anomalies" are no longer hunted.
- **Robert’s Realization:** Standing at David’s grave (an empty marker), Robert realizes a peaceful world has no place for a weapon like him. He cannot go back to being "normal" without David.
- **The Surrender:** Robert walks into the newly formed Global Police station. He confesses to his crimes as a Hitman, a Censor, and a Revolutionary.
- **The Sentence:** He is sentenced to life in "The Vault" (a prison for high-risk Abilities).
- **The Ending:** Robert sits in his cell. He is old, tired, and stripped of his strength. He closes his eyes and imagines the rattle of a train and the warmth of a hand in his. He finally smiles, truly at peace.
