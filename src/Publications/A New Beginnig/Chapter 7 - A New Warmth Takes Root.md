  `The first thing David registered when he woke was the gentle, ethereal light filtering through the blinds, painting soft, pale stripes across the ceiling. It felt almost angelic, a profound sense of peace settling over him, chasing away the usual quiet ache of waking alone. He lay still for a moment, simply breathing, letting the warmth of the sun-drenched room seep into him. He reached out a hand, fingers reaching for the familiar, comforting weight beside him, but his palm met only the cool, empty sheet.`

  `Robert wasn't there.`

  `A tiny prickle of confusion, a phantom chill, ran through David. Had he imagined it all? No, the faint scent of Robert's skin lingered on the pillow beside him, the impression of his head still visible. David sat up, pushing the sheets back, his movements stiff from sleep and perhaps from the intensity of the night before. He swung his legs out of bed, the carpet cool beneath his feet, and began to pull on the sweatpants he'd slept in, then a soft cotton T-shirt.`

  `He padded silently to the bedroom door, then down the short hallway. As he neared the kitchen, a new scent, warm and inviting, wafted towards him: frying onions. David paused just at the threshold, unseen.`

  `Robert was indeed in the kitchen, his back to David, humming tunelessly to himself as he stirred something in a pan on the stove. There was a subtle ease in his shoulders, a relaxation in his posture that David hadn't yet seen. His movements were fluid, unburdened, as if he carried no weight at all. He seemed utterly, completely at peace in the quiet domesticity, the kind of quiet freedom David instinctively understood could only exist when one was truly alone.`

  `But then, as David took a soft, almost imperceptible step forward, Robert's posture shifted. It was fleeting, a barely-there tension in his shoulders, a subtle stiffening, but David caught it. Robert didn't turn, didn't give any indication he'd heard David, but the air around him seemed to thicken just a fraction. He continued to hum, but the melody sounded... rehearsed now. David wondered if he was imagining it.`

  `- "You’re cooking?" David teased, stepping fully into the kitchen.`

  `Robert glanced over his shoulder, a faint smile playing on his lips, the earlier subtle tension gone, replaced by a smooth, innocent surprise. "Thought I’d surprise you," he said.`

  `David chuckled, crossing the room to lean against the counter. "You certainly did. And it smells wonderful." He watched Robert for a moment, noticing the shift back to the more familiar, slightly guarded presence he knew. He puts up his walls even when I'm just approaching, David thought, a pang of something akin to sadness but mostly curiosity. What part of him is so afraid of being seen?`

  `- "Coffee?" Robert asked, gesturing to the pot gurgling on the counter. "It's just brewed."`

  `- "Perfect," David replied. "I could use a cup."`

  `Robert filled two mugs, the steam curling lazily from the dark liquid, and brought them to the old wooden table. They settled into chairs, the warmth of the ceramic radiating through their hands. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mixed with the tantalizing scent of breakfast cooking on the stove, a soothing blend that filled the morning air.`

  `- "I’ve been thinking," Robert started, his voice low, his gaze fixed on his hands, turning them over and over as if searching for answers in their calloused palms.`

  `David set his cup down carefully, his eyes steady on Robert’s face. "Okay," he prompted softly, waiting. He could feel the weight of Robert's unspoken thoughts, the internal struggle behind his hesitant words.`

  `Robert hesitated, his brow furrowed. "This is new. For both of us. And I know we’re... older. Set in our ways. But last night... it wasn’t just—" He stopped, struggling for the words, a faint flush creeping up his neck.`

  `- "Just sex?" David finished for him, his tone gentle, his expression unreadable but warm. He remembered Robert's earlier warning, his plea not to get too close, and he knew how hard this conversation was for Robert.`

  `Robert nodded, his cheeks darkening further. "Yeah." His eyes finally met David's, vulnerable and searching.`

  `David reached out, covering Robert’s hand with his own. He felt the slight tremor in Robert's fingers. "I know," David said, his voice firm, reassuring. "It wasn’t for me either."`

  `They sat like that for a moment, the weight of their shared understanding settling between them, thick and palpable. David let the silence stretch, letting Robert collect his thoughts, knowing that forcing it would only push him away. It was never about pushing. It was showing up, letting Robert feel safe enough to speak.`

  `Finally, Robert looked up, his eyes searching David’s face, a raw honesty in their depths. "I don’t know how to do this," Robert admitted, his voice barely a whisper. "This… this kind of thing. But I want to. I want to try."`

  `David’s heart swelled. The simplicity of Robert’s words hit harder than anything else could have. It wasn't about grand declarations; it was about this man, so guarded and private, admitting a fundamental vulnerability. "Me too," David said, and he squeezed Robert’s hand. "We'll figure it out. Together."`

  `The words were simple, but they carried everything David felt. Hope, fear, excitement—it all tangled together in a way that felt almost too big to contain. But when Robert squeezed his hand back, David knew for a fact that they’d figure it out. Together.`

  `As their hands lingered, a comfortable silence stretched, Robert's eyes, still fixed on David's, suddenly widened. A flicker of something — panic? Embarrassment? — crossed his face before he snatched his hand away and shot to his feet.`

  `- "The food!" Robert exclaimed, his voice a little too loud, a little too strained. He practically rushed back to the stove, grabbing a spatula and turning over the frying onions with exaggerated urgency.`

  `David watched him, a faint smile touching his lips. He was uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy, David thought, a tenderness rising in his chest. It's all so new to him, too. He knew Robert wasn't running from David, but from the raw emotion they had just shared.`

  `Soon, Robert returned with two plates piled high with scrambled eggs and perfectly crisp bacon, the aroma making David's stomach rumble. They ate, the earlier tension replaced by the comfortable sounds of cutlery on ceramic, the conversation light and easy as if nothing profound had just transpired.`

  `When it was time for David to leave for school, a small pang of reluctance hit him. He was so used to the quiet solitude of his mornings, but now, the thought of returning to an empty house at the end of the day, even for a few hours, felt oddly... stark. He pulled on his jacket, a lingering warmth from Robert's proximity clinging to the fabric.`

  `- "I'll see you later," David said, his voice softer than he intended.`

  `Robert nodded, his gaze steady. "Yeah. Have a good day, David."`

  `As David stepped out into the crisp morning air, a different kind of lightness filled him. It wasn't the giddy nervousness of yesterday; it was a sense of peace. The world seemed sharper, colors brighter, all because of the presence of Robert waiting for him at home.`
