  `The walk had been quiet, but it was the kind of silence that wasn’t uncomfortable. It felt like a shared space between them, where words weren’t always necessary. The crunch of leaves underfoot, the distant chirp of crickets, and the soft rustle of wind through the trees created a peaceful soundtrack as they made their way down the narrow path that led toward David's house. Robert walked with his hands shoved deep into his pockets, his hoodie pulled tight against the crisp evening air. David, just a few steps ahead, was his usual upbeat self, smiling at the sight of a dog bounding up to greet them on the trail. Robert gave the dog a distracted pat, his gaze still lost in thought.`

  `The dark clouds had been gathering for the last few minutes, but now, as they neared the end of the path, David could see the storm coming in. The distant rumble of thunder was almost a warning, but neither of them said anything about it. Not yet. David felt a nervous tension building within him, a mirror of the atmospheric pressure.`

  `- "Looks like it's going to rain," David said lightly, glancing over his shoulder at Robert with a grin. "Not that it bothers me much."`

  `Robert didn't respond at first. David noticed his eyes flicking to the darkening sky, a subtle shift in his posture, a heightened awareness David hadn't seen before. The silence thickened, almost like a pressure in the air between them. They’d walked this way countless times now, but this time felt different, charged. Robert’s quiet intensity was a physical presence beside him.`

  `Before he could speak, the first cold drop of rain hit his cheek, and then, without warning, the sky opened up. A deluge came pouring down, soaking them both almost instantly. The path ahead was already turning into a small river, and the rain fell in thick sheets, turning everything into a blur of water and dark shadows.`

  `David let out a startled laugh. "Well, this is something, huh?" David said as he wiped his soaked face. Robert could only nod, his hair already plastered to his forehead, his hoodie dripping as the downpour drummed against the ground.`

  `The rain was relentless, but there was something oddly freeing about it—the world around them seemed to blur, and for a moment, it felt like everything else faded away.`

  `- "I guess we’re stuck," David said, turning back toward the house, and waving for Robert to follow. "Might as well take shelter."`

  `They ran the last few steps toward the house, drenched to the bone. The cool air outside contrasted sharply with the warmth of David's home, and as they stood on the porch, catching their breath, both of them looked like they’d just stepped out of a storm cloud.`

  `David smiled, ever the optimist, shaking his head in disbelief. "I guess we’re stuck with this now." He opened the door, ushering Robert inside. "Come on, let’s get you out of those wet clothes." Robert hesitated, his eyes lingering on David’s face for a long moment, but David’s inviting expression was too warm to refuse. Without another word, Robert followed David inside, drenched.`

  `Once inside, the comforting heat of the house wrapped around them, but the tension that had been building between them since the walk still lingered in the air. The storm pounded against the windows, but it was nothing compared to the storm inside David's own chest.`

  `- "You look like a drowned cat," David teased, chuckling as he pulled off his wet jacket and tossed it aside.`

  `Robert offered a small, self-deprecating smile, the water dripping from his chin onto the floor. David watched him, the way Robert started to tug off his soaked hoodie, his movements a little stiff, as if he wasn’t sure how much to expose. But it was too late now; they were both in the same vulnerable position.`

  `David looked at Robert, his eyes soft but intense. "I’ve got some old clothes you can borrow. Just make yourself comfortable. You don’t have to stand there soaking wet."`

  `Robert hesitated, his mind swirling, a momentary flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. David wondered if it was reluctance, or just the shock of the cold. But after a moment’s pause, he nodded. "Thanks," he muttered.`

  `David disappeared into another room to grab the clothes, and when he returned, he handed Robert a T-shirt and sweatpants. His eyes lingered on Robert for a fraction of a second too long as Robert took the clothes. The soft hum of the storm outside filled the silence between them, and David knew this was one of those moments where things could shift irrevocably.`

  `Robert took the clothes with a silent nod, then turned to change in the hallway, his back to David. When he came back, now in David’s clothes, the fabric hanging a little too loosely on him, David felt his breath catch. The room seemed smaller, more intimate.`

  `David’s smile was warm, but there was an unmistakable tension in his own eyes as he looked at Robert. "Want something to drink?" David asked, moving toward the kitchen. "I’ve got tea. Or... well, I’ve got whiskey, but I’m guessing you’re not in the mood for that."`

  `Robert laughed softly, a low, rusty sound, shaking his head. "Tea sounds good."`

  `David moved with confidence as he prepared the drinks, but he couldn't shake the nervous energy that seemed to hang between them. The storm outside was nothing compared to the storm inside David's heart, the storm of feelings he was finally ready to name. He handed Robert the mug, his smile as warm as ever, but it made David’s chest tighten with anticipation. He wanted to say something, something that would acknowledge everything he was feeling.`

  `Instead, Robert took the tea with a small nod. They stood there, just looking at each other. The quiet was still there, but now it was different. The world outside was still pouring rain, but the pressure inside them was unbearable.`

  `- "Robert," David started, taking a step toward him, his voice quiet but clear, "I... I like you, Robert. A lot more than I’ve liked anyone in a long time… I just wanted you to know that."`

  `Robert froze. David watched his chest rise and fall rapidly, his eyes wide, searching David’s face, looking for some kind of explanation for this confession, but all he found was sincerity.`

  `Robert swallowed hard, his breath catching. "I… I... like you too," he said, barely above a whisper, but the weight of the words hung heavy between them. But then the words spilled out before David could stop them. "But you don’t understand, David. I’m not... I'm not someone you should get close to. People like you—good, decent people—they shouldn’t be with someone like me. I’ll only bring you danger."`

  `David’s gaze softened, his eyes unwavering as he stepped closer. The storm raged on, but here, in the quiet of David’s living room, it was like time had slowed down. "Robert," he said gently, his voice firm but full of understanding. "You don’t have to be perfect. You don’t have to have a perfect past. I like you for who you are. All of you. I don’t care about what’s happened before. I just care about you. Right here. Right now."`

  `For a moment, David watched Robert's face, his heart pounding in his chest. Robert couldn’t breathe, and David could see. He hadn’t expected this kind of understanding–especially not from someone like David. Robert's chest ached, torn between wanting to believe him and the fear of pulling David into a world he didn’t deserve to be a part of. But David was standing there, his eyes steady, unshaken by Robert’s fears.`

  `The air between them was heavy with unspoken words, the storm outside matching the ones brewing inside Robert’s chest. David stood there, so close that Robert could feel the warmth radiating off him, and yet David couldn't shake the feeling of being on the edge of something too big to handle.`

  `But before Robert could say anything else, David reached out, his hands framing Robert’s face, pulling him in with a quiet intensity, his touch both steady and hesitant. Without another word, their lips met in a kiss that was soft at first, tentative, like they were both testing the waters. But then it deepened as everything between them shifted and the world seemed to fade away, leaving just the two of them in that moment.`

  `The kiss deepened, more passionate. David felt Robert’s hands find his waist, pulling him closer, an almost desperate grip. He leaned into Robert, the press of their bodies electric, heartbeats synchronizing as if they were both afraid to let go. David’s own hands explored the warm skin of Robert’s neck, his fingers tangling in the damp hair.`

  `When they finally pulled back, both of them were breathless, their eyes searching each other's faces as if they were both still unsure of what this all meant.`

  `Robert pulled back slightly, his chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. David watched Robert’s fingers tremble as he reached up to touch his lips, his mind a whirl of emotion. Breaking the moment, "I... I don’t deserve you," Robert whispered, his voice thick with emotion, the words slipping out before he could stop them. "You deserve someone better than me."`

  `David shook his head, his hands gently gripping Robert’s shoulders. "Don’t say that," David said, holding him steady as he looked directly into his eyes. "I want this. I want you. And it doesn’t matter what you think, I’m not going anywhere. I’m here. With you."`

  `The rain outside seemed to soften as they stood there, the world outside forgotten. But Robert was here. He was staying. And maybe, David thought, just maybe, Robert could allow himself to believe that he deserved this.`

  `Then, before either of them could think any more about it, their lips met again, this time with a force that was unmistakable. The kiss was urgent now, as if they both knew this was the moment everything would change. David felt Robert’s hands find their way to his back, pulling him closer, feeling the heat of his body press against his. He was acutely aware of every brush of skin, every soft gasp between kisses.`

  `They were both moving now, unsteady, caught between the need for closeness and the uncertainty of what they were about to do. David felt Robert’s larger hand reach down, finding the hem of his borrowed T-shirt, and David instinctively met the movement, reaching for Robert’s shirt. Their clothes came off almost in a rush, each of them fumbling with buttons, pulling at fabric, too eager and too nervous all at once.`

  `When they finally stood there, bare and exposed to each other in the dim light of the living room, David felt a wave of exhilarating vulnerability. Robert’s eyes, even in the low light, seemed to hold a deeper knowledge, a controlled confidence David hadn't entirely expected from someone who had earlier professed "not knowing" about relationships. Robert’s movements, though still a little hesitant, carried an underlying familiarity, a subtle way he held his body, or the curve of his hand as he reached for David, that made David wonder. He's not as new to this as I am, David thought, a flicker of surprise and a strange comfort passing through him. Or maybe he's just a natural. He didn't press the thought, too caught up in the moment.`

  `- "Are you sure?" Robert’s voice was shaky, David observed, unsure of his thoughts. "This… this is a big step. I don’t know if I’m the kind of person you need."`

  `David cupped Robert’s face again, his thumb brushing over his cheek. "I’m sure," he said softly, his voice calm but filled with certainty, "I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life."`

  `With those words, Robert let go of the last of his doubts. He closed the distance between them, and their lips met again, this time without hesitation. The kiss was slow and tender, as if they were both savoring the feeling of finally being this close. The world outside didn’t matter anymore. The storm had started to subside, and the storm inside them had quieted as well.`

  `The night unfolded in a haze of soft touches, quiet whispers, and the overwhelming feeling of being completely and utterly vulnerable. David learned the feel of Robert’s skin, the rise and fall of his breath against his cheek, the quiet gasps Robert made when David touched him in just the right way. They moved together, learning the rhythm of each other’s bodies, giving and receiving, unsure but completely present in the moment.`

  `And when it was over, when the world outside was finally still, they lay together in the warmth of David’s bed, close but still unsure, tangled in the sheets, both of them wide awake and feeling something they hadn’t expected—a deep connection, fragile but real. Their bodies ached, but it was a good ache, one that spoke of a new beginning and trust.`

  `They didn’t speak much that night, both too filled with emotion to find the right words. They fell asleep together, wrapped up in the quiet, in the soft glow of a moment they would both remember forever.`
