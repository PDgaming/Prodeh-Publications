## `Part I - Beneath the Mask`

  `Robert leaned back into the couch, the weight of everything pressing down on him. His hands were clenched, nails digging into his palms, and his mind wandered through the maze of memories he’d buried for years. The room felt too small, too suffocating. The walls were closing in, the quiet hum of the air conditioner almost deafening against the storm in his chest. He had to do this—he had to tell David the truth, even if it meant losing him.`

  `David sat across from him, his eyes never leaving Robert, searching, waiting. David has always been like that, patient, never rushing, as if he could wait a lifetime for Robert to finally open up. But now, Robert could feel the pressure of that gaze like a thousand questions being silently asked.`

  `Robert exhaled slowly, feeling the weight of the past flooding back, the memories he had always lurked in the corners of his mind, never fully gone. The things he had done, the things he had been. The things he had become.`

  `- “I told you before, my life wasn’t always this... simple,” Robert began, his voice low. He swallowed, trying to steady himself. “But you deserve to know the truth. I wasn’t just some guy trying to get by. I was in the mafia.”`

  `David froze, the words hitting him like a punch to the chest. For a moment, he couldn’t process them, his mind scrambling to make sense of what Robert had just said. Mafia? The man he loved—this kind, gentle, quiet man—had been part of something like that?`

  `- “The Takayuki family…” Robert continued, his tone steady but distant. “It wasn't just a mafia family. It was an empire. We had a big network of influence stretching from the East Coast to the West. We had influence everywhere. Politicians, law enforcement, businessmen… we controlled things from behind the scenes. We controlled everything.”`

  `David’s breath caught, his pulse pounding in his ears. He opened his mouth to speak, but couldn’t find the words. He stared at Robert, his mind flooded with questions. How? Why? The man he had been building a life with, sharing quiet mornings and deep conversations, suddenly it felt like David didn’t even recognize the man sitting across from him.`

  `Finally, he managed to stammer, “ren, I—” He stopped, running a hand through his hair, his voice trembling. “You’re telling me you... You were part of that? The corruption, the violence?”`

  `Robert’s gaze didn’t waver, though his expression tightened. “I wasn’t just part of it, David,” he said, his voice darkening. “I ran it.”`

  `The room felt colder, the weight of Robert’s confession pressing down on both of them. David leaned back, his chest tightening. He tried to reconcile the man he knew—the man who always seemed to know exactly what to say, who had quietly become his anchor—with the image Robert was painting.`

  `- “Jesus Christ,” David muttered, rubbing his face with his hands. “I don’t even... I mean, this is you? The man sitting in front of me? You were in the mafia?” He looked up at Robert, his eyes wide, searching for something—an explanation, a crack in this terrible truth. But Robert’s face remained solemn, and David felt his stomach churn.`

  `Robert’s gaze drifted to the floor, but he didn’t see it. His mind was elsewhere, back in the past, a time when the world had been black and white. There were no rules, only power and loyalty. He could feel the weight of the gun in his hand, the rush of control, the satisfaction of power.`

  `- “Loan sharking, extortion, illegal casinos, underground fights, weapons deals—if it made money, we controlled it.” He continued. “We had people in positions of power everywhere—police, politicians, judges… anyone who could make a phone call and make our problems disappear.” Robert paused for a while, then continued, “We didn’t touch drugs or human trafficking, but that doesn’t make me innocent.” His jaw tightened. “The dirty work, too—torture, assassinations—those weren’t just orders I gave. I was the one doing it too. Not because I wanted to, but because I had to. At least, that’s what I told myself…”`

 `Robert’s hands trembled as he spoke, the memories crashing into him, relentless and unforgiving. The smell of blood, the sound of screams, the weight of a body in his arms as it was carried away… he had seen it all, done it all. And yet, it didn’t faze him. Not until it was too late. Not until everything inside him had been drained dry.`

  `- “But... you had to do it, didn’t you? There was no other option…” David asked, his voice steady, though the weight of his question hung in the air. He couldn’t quite comprehend the depth of Robert’s involvement, but something in him wanted to understand. “It wasn’t something you wanted… right?”`

  `Robert’s gaze dropped to his hands, his voice softening. “At first, you do it to survive. To protect what’s yours. But then it becomes... easier. You stop questioning it. You tell yourself it’s just business, but deep down, you know better. You know you’re destroying lives.” Robert’s lips curled into something almost like a smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. His gaze remained fixed on the wall. “There were moments… when I enjoyed it. The rush. The power you feel when someone’s life is in your hands. I don’t know how to explain it... But it was a part of me.”`

  `The room felt heavy with his words. David’s heart raced, but he didn’t speak. He didn’t move.  David swallowed hard, unable to tear his gaze away from Robert. His chest tightened as he absorbed the weight of Robert’s words. He didn’t know what to think—what to feel. But something in his gut churned with unease. Was this the man he was in love with? The man he had thought was so kind, so gentle?`

  `Robert stood up, pacing now, his hands clenched at his sides. “But then, slowly, I didn’t care anymore. I was numb. People came and went. Families destroyed. Lives were taken for money, for power. We do what’s to be done, and we never ask questions. But... I started asking. I started seeing the damage, the broken people who were left behind after every job. And it... It started to change me.”`

  `Robert stopped pacing and turned to face him. “I could have left. I could have walked away at any point. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. The control I had, the power—it was too much. I thought I had everything. Power. Control. The world was mine, David. It was about necessity, the necessity for control and power. But... but I wasn’t happy. I was empty.”`

  `Robert swallowed hard, his throat tight. “Then,” Robert continued, his tone softer now. “I finally walked away. I left it all behind. I retired, gave control to someone else, and tried to disappear. I figured I could start over. I didn’t want to be part of that world anymore. I didn’t want to hurt anyone else. I came here to live a quiet life far away from that world.”`

  `Robert’s voice cracked slightly as he spoke, his emotions slipping through the cracks he’d spent years building. “And then I met you, David.” Robert stopped, his voice catching in his throat as he looked up at David for the first time in what felt like an eternity. David’s eyes were wide with concern, but they didn’t hold fear. Not yet. Robert could see it—the understanding, the trust that had been there, that David still clung to despite the darkness Robert had just revealed.`

  `- “I let my guard down. I thought... maybe I could have something different, you made me think that maybe I could actually live differently. That I could have something real. Something that didn’t involve blood and lies… To be something other than the monster I had become.”`

  `Robert swallowed hard, the lump in his throat almost suffocating him. His chest felt hollow like it was being crushed under the weight of everything he had done. The guilt, the shame, the regret—it was all rushing back, drowning him.`

  `- “But even after I walked away, the ghosts of it all still follow me, no matter how far I run, I can’t leave that part of me behind.” He finally looked at David, his eyes shadowed with guilt. “It’s still there, David. Every face, every name, every moment I can’t take back. The things I left behind, don’t just disappear. It’s not that simple. And now… now I’m being pulled back into it. Into a world I thought I had left behind. A world that doesn’t let you go. They found me, David. And now I’m wondering if I’ve already dragged you into it. I don’t want you to be a part of my world. Not anymore.”`

  `David remained silent, his face etched with concern, but his gaze never wavered from Robert’s. He was quiet for a long time, processing everything Robert had said. He didn’t know what to say—how to respond to such raw honesty.`
