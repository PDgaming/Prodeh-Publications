  `School that day was a blur, not in a chaotic way, but as if David’s mind operated on a different plane. He found himself staring blankly at a particularly convoluted stanza of Shakespeare, the words blurring, his thoughts drifting to the feel of Robert's hand in his, the unexpected warmth of waking beside him. A student asked a question, and David paused, a moment too long, before pulling himself back to the present. The scent of Eleanor’s old rosewater, which he still used on his clothes, seemed to mix with Robert's earthy, rain-scented presence that still clung to him. The day dragged, each minute pushing him closer to the moment he could return home. The thought of Robert being there, waiting, was a quiet, insistent hum beneath his skin, a new rhythm to his once solitary routine.`

  `Towards the end of the school day, David found himself teaching his senior English class about the power of narrative perspective. He walked among the desks, the hum of the overhead lights a familiar drone. "Think about it," he paused, tapping a hand on a desk, capturing their attention. "Every story has a narrator, right? And that narrator's perspective shapes everything you perceive. What they see, what they choose to tell, what they don't see, what they hide—it all creates your reality as a reader."`

  `A student, Chloe, with bright, inquisitive eyes, raised her hand. "So, like, can a narrator lie, Mr. Graham?"`

  `David smiled faintly. "Not just lie, Chloe. They can omit. They can mislead. They can simply be unaware of the full truth. Think about the unreliable narrator. Or just the limited narrator. We're all limited narrators in our own lives, aren't we? We only see a fraction of the full story."`

  `Another student, Mark, a quiet boy who often surprised David with his insights, chimed in. "So... we never really know what's true?"`

  `David considered this, his gaze drifting to the window, the late afternoon sun painting stripes across the quad. "We can only ever know our own truth, and try to piece together the truths of others from the fragments they share. And sometimes, even the fragments are illusions." He turned back to the class, a thoughtful expression on his face. "But that doesn't mean the attempt to understand isn't worthwhile. It's the most human thing we can do."`

  `The bell shrilled, cutting through his words, a sound that released a collective sigh of relief from the students. Books slammed shut, chairs scraped, and a tide of young voices surged into the hallway. David lingered, gathering his papers, the silence that followed the exodus of students feeling vast and empty. This was his space, his routine. He was part of the school’s very fabric, a familiar fixture, existing in the ebb and flow of semesters, always the same. Amidst the comforting predictability of it all, the memory of Robert waiting for him at home had, for a fleeting moment, completely slipped his mind. The thought was replaced by the simple, ingrained motion of his daily commute.`

  `He finally left the school, the air outside cool and crisp, a clear contrast to the stale warmth of the classrooms. He walked the familiar route to the train station, his bag heavy on his shoulder. Just like every other day, he found his usual seat by the window. The train rattled gently over the tracks, its motion rhythmic, hypnotic. The world outside, bathed in the soft, golden light of late afternoon, passed by in a blur – the buildings and trees, sharp and clear under a sky that was a clear, brilliant blue.`

  `He closed his eyes for a moment, the memory of that very first ride, the rainy day, the mysterious stranger, washing over him. When he opened them, the train was pulling into his station. He grabbed his bag and stepped onto the platform, and only then, as the cool evening air wrapped around him, was it no longer just the chill of the twilight. He wasn't alone anymore. He wouldn't find an empty house tonight, at least not in the same way he used to. Robert would be there.`

  `He walked home, the light growing dim, a pleasant hum of anticipation building in his chest. He reached his front door, his hand already reaching for the knob, when he heard it: the faint, familiar murmur of a TV from inside, a sound he hadn't heard in ages when coming home.`

  `He pushed the door open, and the scent of something faintly spicy, a leftover aroma from dinner, drifted out. A warmth, both literal and figurative, embraced him, and there Robert was, stretched out on the couch, watching a documentary, a half-empty plate on the coffee table beside him. Robert looked up, his face softening into a relaxed smile that David had only recently begun to recognize.`

  `- "Hey," Robert said, his voice easy. "Dinner's on the table if you're hungry."`

  `- "It's good to see you," David replied, a genuine smile spreading across his face. The familiar ache of solitude, once a constant companion, had vanished the moment he stepped inside.`

  `They spent the rest of the evening in a comfortable, companionable quiet. David ate the delicious, simple meal Robert had prepared and then joined him on the couch. They watched the documentary, occasionally commenting on the strange facts flickering across the screen, their shoulders brushing. It was a new kind of normalcy, a shared space that felt both comfortable and exciting.`

  `As the evening wore on and the documentary came to an end, Robert stretched, then stood. "I should probably head home."`

  `David felt a familiar pang of disappointment, a small, quiet ache in his chest. He wished Robert would stay, but he didn't push. "Oh. Already?" he asked, trying to keep his voice light. "You could just leave from here in the morning, you know."`

  `Robert hesitated, his gaze drifting towards the window, then back to David, with a subtle tension in his jaw. "No. I... I've got something I need to take care of back at my place." His voice was low, and David knew, instinctively, that this was a private reason, something Robert wasn't ready to share. He didn't press.`

  `- "Okay," David said, a soft sigh escaping him. He moved to the door with Robert, a lingering warmth in his hand as they clasped farewell. "I'll see you tomorrow night, then?"`

  `- "Yeah," Robert confirmed, offering a faint smile. "Definitely."`

  `As Robert walked away, disappearing into the dim evening, David lingered in the doorway, the quiet of the house settling in around him. It wasn't the stark, suffocating silence he'd known before Robert. It was softer now, filled with the recent echoes of Robert's presence, the memory of his laugh, his quiet companionship. He was alone, but no longer lonely. Yet, a faint sadness still lingered, a quiet yearning for the presence that had just left. He closed the door, the click echoing in the suddenly too-quiet space, already anticipating tomorrow evening.`
