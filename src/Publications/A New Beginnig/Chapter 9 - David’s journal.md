***`March 17th`***

*`I wasn’t sure I’d write tonight. It’s been one of those long days—school was chaotic, the kind where every student has some kind of crisis or half-baked excuse. I almost just went straight to bed. But then Robert smiled at me over dinner. One of those rare, unguarded smiles that made everything else fade into the background.`*

*`It’s funny—I started keeping this journal years ago as a way to organize my thoughts. Now it feels more like a conversation with myself, like a way to figure out what I’m feeling when the words feel too tangled in my head. And lately? Everything feels... different.`*

*`I’ve spent so many years living life on autopilot. I didn’t even realize how quiet everything had gotten until Robert came along. He didn’t crash into my world like some dramatic story. It was quieter than that. He just showed up and, somehow, stayed.`*

*`And now? Now, my world feels... brighter. No, that’s not quite it. Warmer.`*

*`I keep catching myself watching him. Not in a weird way—I don’t think so, anyway—but just in those little moments when he thinks no one’s paying attention. Like when he’s messing with that old guitar of his, trying to remember how to play. Or when he sneaks sugar into his coffee and acts like I don’t notice. He has this way of being so careful with me, even though he doesn’t seem to realize he’s doing it.`*

*`He’s not easy to read, though. Sometimes he feels like a book with half the pages missing. I don’t know everything about his past, and I’m not sure he’s ready to tell me. There’s a shadow, a quiet intensity I still don’t understand, that appears in his eyes sometimes, especially when he's lost in thought, or when he thinks I'm not watching. But I think that’s okay. He’s here, with me, and that’s enough for now.`*

*`The thing is, I never thought I’d feel this way again. Hell, I wasn’t even sure I wanted to feel this way again. But Robert makes me want to try.`*

*`God, that sounds so cheesy written out like this. Maybe I’ve been grading too many essays lately.`*

*`But it’s true. He’s been reminding me that life doesn’t have to be perfect to be good. That, maybe the little things—the quiet moments, the laughs we share, the way he trusts me to just be with him—those are the things that matter the most.`*

*`I don’t know where this is going. And maybe I don’t need to. For now, it’s enough to know that Robert is here and that I’m not facing the world alone anymore.`*

*`All right, I’m rambling now. Time to wrap this up. Tomorrow’s another long day, but at least I know I’ll have Robert waiting for me at home.`*

*`Who would’ve thought I’d ever get to write that?`*
