Sunday mornings were always the quietest. There were no trains to catch, no lessons to plan, and no voices but his own. The rain had passed sometime during the night, leaving the street washed clean and pale beneath a sky that hadn't yet decided what it wanted to be. The air felt heavy, as if the neighborhood itself was reluctant to wake.

David filled the kettle at the sink and watched the steam fog the window as the burner clicked on beneath it. He carried a stack of essays back to the couch, settling into the familiar hollow in the cushions. His red pen hovered above the page. he read the same line twice, then a third time.

They hadn't understood the poem at all.

Suddenly, the doorbell rang. The unexpected sound startled David. The sound felt too sharp for the house, too loud for a house that grown used to silence. He stayed where he was for a moment, pen still in his hand, listening as if the bell might explain itself.

It didn't.

He set the papers aside and stood, his movements slower now, cautious. Visitors were rare. Visitors on a Sunday morning were unheard of. As he crossed the room, a tight, unfamiliar feeling settled in his chest.

He leaned toward the peephole, then hesitated before looking through it. When he did, his breath caught.

The man from the train stood on the other side of the door.

David's fingers fumbled with the lock. He told himself it was stiff, that it always caught like that, but his hands betrayed him. His heart thudded hard against his ribs, the way it used to when he was late for something that mattered.

The door opened.

Up close, the man looked much the same as he had yesterday, quiet, unreadable, his expression neither hostile nor friendly. He held something folded over his arm.

"I believe this belongs to you," he said, his voice low and even.

The coat.

David took it without thinking, his hands already searching the inside pocket. His fingers brushed paper. He drew it out slowly, as if moving too fast might make it disappear again.

The diary.

For a moment, he couldn't speak. His thumb traced the worn edge of the cover while his other hand clenched the wool of the coat, grounding himself in the weight of it.

"Thank you," he said finally. His voice came out thinner than he expected. "I didn't think I'd see it again."

The man nodded, as if that were enough. He shifted his weight, already turning away.

"Wait."

The word escaped David before he'd decided to say it. The man paused, looking back, a faint crease of uncertainty crossing his face.

"I-" David swallowed. "I owe you one. At least... come in for a moment. I was about to make some tea." 

The offer felt sudden, even to him. He didn't know why he'd said it. Only that the thought of the door closing again, of the morning sealing itself back into silence, felt wrong.

The man studied him for a second longer than necessary. Then he gave a small  nod.

"That would be nice."

Inside, the house felt warmer, closer. The man glanced around as he followed David in, not curious, not intrusive, simply attentive, as if the walls were speaking in a language he half-remembered.

"You have a beautiful home," he said.

"Thanks," David replied. "My wife had a good eye for these things."

The words landed softly, as if they'd been set down rather than spoken. He didn't look at the man as he said them. He gestured toward the kitchen table instead.

"I'm David."

"Robert."

Robert sat where David indicated, his hands resting on the table, fingers loosely interlaced. He watched as David moved about the kitchen, lifting the kettle from the stove. The smell of hot metal and water filled the air.

"I'm really grateful," David said, setting two cups down. "For the diary."

He hesitated, then went on, quieter now. "It means more to me than it probably should."

Robert didn't respond. He didn't interrupt. He simply listened.

"I used to talk more," David added, almost to the kettle as he poured. "About nothing, really. Small things."

He smiled faintly, then let the smile fade.

"I suppose I've always needed words," he said after a moment. "That's probably why I ended up teaching."

He carried the cups to the table and slid one toward Robert.

"And you?" David asked. "What do you do?"

Robert's fingers tightened around the cup before he answered. "I work at a supermarket."

David nodded. "That's honest work."

Robert huffed a quiet, humorless breath. "Yeah. I don't know."

He stared into the tea, watching the steam thin and vanish.

"It's quieter than people think," he said, then stopped, as if surprised by his own voice. "Being alone."

The words hung between them.

Robert lifted his cup and set it down again, a little too close. His fingers brushed David’s hand.

Cold.

The contact lasted only a second, but it felt longer, longer enough for David to register the warmth in his own skin, long enough for something unspoken to pass between them.

Robert pulled back immediately, pushing his chair away from the table.

"I- I should go," he said. He smiled, but it didn't quite hold. "Thank you for the tea."

David stood as well, though he wasn't sure why. He walked Robert to the door.

"Thank you," David said again. "For bringing everything back. And... If you'd life. We could talk again. Sometime."

Robert nodded, already stepping outside.

When the door closed, the house seemed to exhale. The kettle clicked softly as it cooled. One cup of tea sat untouched on the table.

David remained where he was for a moment longer, listening to the quiet settle back into place.

It felt the same as it had that morning.

And yet, somehow, it wasn't.
