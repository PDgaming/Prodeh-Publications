The park felt very alive with the sounds of a Sunday afternoon. Children’s laughter mixed with the rustling of leaves as a soft breeze carried the chirping of birds.
David hadn’t planned to visit the park today, but the warm sunlight streaming through his window had coaxed him outside of his house. Now, he wandered aimlessly, the gravel crunching under his shoes, his thoughts as scattered as the dappled sunlight on the path.
He stopped near a wooden bench shaded by an ancient oak tree, and noticed a familiar figure sitting on it. Slightly hunched forward, hands resting on his knees.

Robert.

David's breath hitched in a pleasant surprise. He hadn’t truly expected it. Robert’s usual guarded expression was gone, softened as he watched a pair of sparrows flit around a small puddle.

“Robert?” David called out, tentative but warm.

Robert looked up, surprise flickering before a faint smile settled on his face; genuine, unguarded, and unexpectedly light. "David," he said. "Guess life still enjoys its little coincidences."

David’s smile and gestured to the empty space. “Mind if I join you?”

Robert shifted to make room.

“Do you come here often?” David asked.

Robert shook his head, gaze drifting back to the birds. David caught the subtle tension in his shoulders, the tight line of his jaw. “Not really. I’m not much of an ‘outdoors’ person." He paused. "But sometimes... sometimes I just need to get out of the house. Too many ghosts in there."

David nodded in understanding. He glanced at the sparrows hopping about, and a wistful smile touched his lips as a familiar ache settled in his chest.
“Eleanor… she used to love this park. She’d bring breadcrumbs to feed the birds every Sunday morning." He said, his gaze following one of the birds flying up to a tree.
"Said it was her way of making friends." He looked towards Robert. "The birds, the breeze, the sound of children playing. Said they reminded her that life’s beauty is always in the little moments.”
The sparrows flew away as a group of joggers passed, their footsteps echoing down the path.
After a moment, Robert continued, his voice low and deliberate, almost a murmur against the soft park sounds. "I was married once. Had a family too. A wife and a couple of kids." David observed the way Robert’s eyes seemed to lose focus, looking inward rather than at anything external.
“But I… I wasn’t a good man back then.”
David’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, but he stayed silent.
"I knew I could never handle alcohol well, but I drank anyway. Told myself it was just one night, just to take the edge off." A deep self-reflective sigh escaped Robert's lips.
"Came home angry and drunk one night, crossed a line I can’t uncross. Nothing irreversible, but enough." Robert rubbed his face in frustration.
"Enough for her to pack her bags, take the kids, and walk out."
"That was it. I haven’t seen them since. Haven’t heard from them either. Not once.”
David’s could hear the regret in Robert’s voice, the raw pain that mirrored his own. He also wondered, briefly, what kind of “line” could cause such permanent severance.
"That must've been really hard. Losing a family..." David looked at Robert, the man still looking at the ground beneath.
"It leaves a void that's hard to fill" he finished softly, his voice gentle.
"Hard doesn't cover it. I've spent years trying to clean up my act. Got a steady job and stayed sober. But some mistakes..." Robert stopped, as if remembering the mistake he'd made.
"they don't just go away. And now, well..." he gestured vaguely to the world around him, a heavy sigh escaping him. "It's just me and the ghosts."

David watched Robert. He gently placed a hand on Robert's arm. "Those ghosts..." he said softly, "they can be persistent, but for what it's worth, I think it's really brave that you're here. Trying."
Robert looked up at David for the first time, and paused before saying anything.

“Thanks. That means more than you know.”

After a while, David shifted slightly, feeling a pleasant weariness settle over him. “It’s funny the things you find yourself thinking about when you’re just sitting here, isn’t it?” He offered a small, gentle smile.
Robert nodded slowly, a hint of a smile returning. “It is. Sometimes it’s good to just… be.”

They sat there for a while longer, but at the company of each other.

The warmth of the afternoon sun soon began to fade. The air grew a touch cooler, and the sounds of the park seemed to soften. The setting sun casting long shadows across the path, painting the scene in hues of orange and gold.

The peaceful companionship they had found was a welcome change for Robert, David observed, a rare moment of genuine connection.
Finally, Robert stood, shivering slightly, brushing off his pants, “It’s getting late. I should head back.”
David stood too, smiling faintly. “Yeah, me too. This was nice, though. Talking."
“It was,” Robert agreed, hesitating for a moment. “Maybe we could do it again sometime?”
David’s smile widened. “I’d like that.”

As Robert walked away, David stayed on the bench, watching him disappear down the path. The space beside him felt larger than it had a moment ago.

He turned toward the fading sunlight, and as the sunlight lingered on his hands, for once, David didn't rush to stand.
