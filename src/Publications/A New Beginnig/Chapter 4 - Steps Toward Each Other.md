  `The café was small and tucked away on a quiet street, the kind of place you wouldn’t notice unless someone told you about it. David sat at a corner table by the window, his fingers idly tracing the rim of his coffee cup. Outside, the world moved on in its usual rhythm; pedestrians hurrying by, cars splashing through puddles left by last night’s rain. But inside, the air was warm, laced with the aroma of roasted beans and the faint hum of soft jazz playing in the background. David had arrived a little early, a nervous flutter in his chest that he hadn’t expected. He found himself looking forward to these meetings with Robert more than he cared to admit, a fresh current in the quiet stream of his life.`

  `The bell over the door jingled, and David looked up to see Robert stepping inside. His usual guarded demeanor seemed lighter today, though his hands were shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket. Spotting David, he gave a small nod before making his way over.`

  `- “You’re early,” David said with a smile, gesturing to the empty chair across from him.`

  `Robert shrugged, sitting down and removing his jacket. “Not much else to do on a day like this.” David noticed a slight ease in Robert’s posture, as if he was beginning to settle into the idea of these regular meetings too.`

  `David chuckled, lifting his cup. “Fair enough. Coffee?”`

  `Robert hesitated but nodded. “Sure. Black.”`

  `David waved to the barista, ordering another coffee. As they waited, an easy silence settled between them, the kind that had started to feel natural in their company. David found it remarkable how quickly he’d grown accustomed to Robert’s quiet presence, how comfortable the stillness felt when it was shared.`

  `When the coffee arrived, Robert took a sip and leaned back in his chair, his eyes scanning the room. “It’s nice here. Quiet.”`

  `- “Yeah, I come here sometimes when I need to get away. It’s good for thinking—or grading papers,” David said with a small laugh.`

  `Robert smirked. “You teachers. Always working.”`

  `- "Guilty as charged," David replied, smiling. "But it’s not just work. Sometimes, it’s just… nice to sit and watch the world go by."`

  `Robert’s gaze softened, and he nodded, as if he understood more than he let on. "My wife used to say the same thing. She’d always drag me to places like this. Said I needed to ‘slow down and see the beauty in the ordinary.’ I never really got it back then."`

  `David tilted his head, his curiosity piqued. "And now?"`

  `Robert stared into his coffee, his voice quieter. "Now… I think she was right. But it took losing her to realize that." David felt a pang of sympathy, a shared understanding of how loss could sharpen one’s perspective on life's quiet graces.`

  `- "It’s never too late, you know. To start seeing it," David said gently.`

  `Robert looked at him, something unspoken passing between them. "Maybe," he said softly, and David saw a hint of vulnerability in his eyes, a willingness to consider the possibility.`

  `They spent the next hour talking about books David was reading, music Robert used to play, even the strange local news stories that sometimes popped up. For the first time, David heard Robert laugh, a low, rusty sound that seemed to surprise Robert himself, a genuine warmth spreading across his face. David, watching Robert’s guarded walls begin to crumble, felt a warmth he hadn’t realized he’d been missing. It wasn't just comfort; it was a sense of hope, a belief that something good, something real, was finally taking root in his life.`

  `When they finally stepped outside, the sun had dipped lower in the sky, painting the world in hues of gold and amber. They walked together for a while, the conversation meandering, until they reached the park again.`

  `Robert stopped, his hands in his pockets, and looked at David. "Thanks for this. I don’t… I don’t usually do things like this."`

  `David smiled. "Neither do I. But I’m glad we did."`

  `Robert nodded, the corners of his mouth quirking into the faintest of smiles. "Me too."`

  `They stood there for a moment, the silence stretching between them, not uncomfortable but heavy with meaning. Robert’s gaze dropped to his hands, fidgeting slightly before he looked back at David. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but the words didn’t come. Instead, he gave a quick nod. His lips pressed into a thin line. David wondered what he'd almost said, but didn't press.`

  `- "I should get going," Robert said quietly, his voice almost apologetic.`

  `David watched as Robert turned to leave, his footsteps crunching softly against the gravel path. For a second, Robert paused, glancing back over his shoulder. Their eyes met, and David offered him a small, encouraging smile, a silent reassurance that there was no judgment here, only understanding.`

  `Robert hesitated, then gave a faint smile in return. "Thanks, David. For listening."`

  `- "Anytime," David replied gently, his voice carrying a warmth that lingered even as Robert walked away.`

  `As Robert disappeared into the distance, David found himself standing alone, a strange mix of emotions swirling in his chest. He didn’t know what was happening between them—what it was, or what it could be. But for the first time in a long while, he felt something stirring, a glimmer of something he wasn’t sure he was ready to name.`
