  `The fluorescent hum of Prince Chopper was a dull ache in Robert’s ears. He stood by the checkout lane, mindlessly packing groceries into the bags, the sound of plastic rustling and items clinking, a backdrop to his exhaustion. An elderly woman’s canned goods, a young couple’s fresh produce, a harried mother’s overflowing cart – they all passed through his hands, indistinguishable, unmemorable. This was his life now. A quiet, purposeful non-existence, a muted echo of the impactful work he'd once pursued. He remembered a time when he'd been a software developer, part of a vibrant, well-funded startup founded by young idealists. They had built tech solutions for solving everyday problems. Back then, his mind had felt sharp, his efforts meaningful; he was changing society, even in small ways. Now, that sense of purpose was gone. His life felt dull, his life’s peak long past, reducing him to just another old, seemingly useless member of society. He glanced at the clock above aisle seven: 8:57 PM. Three minutes. He just needed three more minutes.`

  `A figure sidled up beside him, leaning against the bagging station with an easy slouch. Kyle, barely out of high school, chewing gum with an open mouth. “Hey, old man,” Kyle mumbled, not bothering to make eye contact as he tapped his watch. “Looks like your shift’s up. You gonna stick around and help out, or are you too busy with your… reading?” The word was laced with a sneer, a reference to Robert’s habit of passing slow moments with a dog-eared paperback. Robert had noticed the younger staff’s casual disrespect, their whispers, their assumptions. He was just another old guy bagging groceries, beneath their notice, or perhaps, in their minds, beneath their respect.`

  `Robert grunted, a noncommittal sound. “I’m done.” His shoulders ached. His feet throbbed. The idea of another minute under these harsh lights felt like a physical assault.`

  `Kyle rolled his eyes. “Whatever, old timer. Just asking. You know, teamwork and all that.” He pushed off the counter, heading towards the next register.`

  `Robert didn’t respond. He merely picked up the last bag, handed it to a customer with a polite, practiced nod, and watched them walk away. The transaction was complete. His duty for the day was done. He moved towards the staff locker room, the sound of the automatic doors hissing open and closed behind him.`

  `As he passed the staff cafeteria, the door stood ajar, and a burst of giggling spilled out. Two young women, both cashiers, were slumped in chairs, feet up on the table, scrolling on their phones.`

  `- “Did you see that old weirdo on checkout four?” one of them, a blonde with bright pink hair streaks, scoffed. “He gives me the creeps. Just stares at the bags. Probably a pedo.”`

  `The other, dark-haired and sullen, snickered. “Totally. Or like, some kind of rapist hiding out. Why else would someone that old be working here?”`

  `Robert didn’t flinch. His footsteps didn't falter. The words were not new. They were like the background hum of the fluorescent lights – irritating, meaningless, and entirely predictable. He walked into the locker room, the fluorescent hum of the cafeteria still echoing in his ears. He calmly unzipped his Prince Chopper vest, peeled off his polo shirt, and pulled on his worn jacket. The cheap fabric of the uniform fell to the floor, discarded until tomorrow. He zipped up his jacket, turned off the light, and walked out, the sounds of their mockery fading into the vast emptiness of the parking lot.`

  `The cool night air hit him like a wake-up call, sharp and biting, a stark contrast to the stagnant warmth of the supermarket. He got into his car, the worn leather of the steering wheel a familiar comfort under his hands, and started the engine. The sound was a low growl, the only thing that felt real in the sudden silence. The road stretched out before him, slick with the remnants of an earlier rain, and his headlights sliced through the misty dark. The city lights blurred into streaks of color, a distant, detached flicker against the heavy sky. It should have been peaceful. It should have felt like the quiet end to a long, hard day. But something clung to him, like a shadow that refused to let go.`

  `The drive home was long. The silence in the car was thick, pressing in. He kept glancing at his rearview mirror, his gaze flicking to the empty road behind him, then to the dark houses that flashed by. No one. Yet, the feeling persisted, a cold prickle on the back of his neck. He tried to shake it off, dismissing it as lingering exhaustion, the ghosts of old habits. But the old habits, the instincts, were roaring to life, unbidden, unwanted. He hadn’t felt this wired, this alert, in years. Not since he’d traded his old world of influence for a grocery apron.`

  `When he finally pulled into his driveway, the house looked as quiet and unwelcoming as ever. It was a blocky, angular shape against the dim streetlights, its windows like dark, unseeing eyes. The sparse lawn, damp and shadowed, seemed to retreat into itself. The paint on the siding, a faded blue, seemed to absorb what little light there was, casting the whole structure in a cool, desolate hue. Utterly devoid of warmth, it stood as a silent sentinel to his solitude. It was always empty now, in a way that felt both comforting and suffocating. The engine’s hum faded into the quiet night, leaving behind only the distant drone of the city and the thumping of his own heart.`

  `His headlights shone on the small, weathered mailbox at the end of the driveway, and Robert’s eyes caught something strange—an envelope resting inside, like it had been waiting for him, almost too perfectly positioned. It didn’t belong. There were no markings, no return address, just a slip of heavy paper that seemed out of place against the faded background of bills and junk mail.`

  `Robert sat there for a moment, his hands gripping the steering wheel a little too tightly. His gut churned with unease. He should leave it. He should just go inside and pretend it wasn't there. But a perverse curiosity, a professional wariness he thought he’d buried, pulled him. He opened the door and stepped out into the cool air. The ground was damp beneath his shoes, the night air thick with the smell of wet Earth. He crossed to the mailbox and pulled the envelope out, his fingers brushing the smooth, heavier-than-expected paper. A sense of unease settled deeper in his stomach as the silence around him seemed to press in, thick and suffocating, as if the world itself had quieted just for this moment.`

  `He stared at it for a long beat, unsure why something as innocuous as an envelope made him feel so unsettled. Maybe it was the way it was just… there, waiting for him. Or maybe it was the way the night felt too still, the weight of the moment making his chest tighten.`

  `He shoved it into his jacket pocket, trying to shake off the feeling, and turned back toward the house. He didn’t need this. He didn’t need anything else right now, not when he was finally starting to feel… something. A quiet warmth. But as he crossed the yard, hoping it was nothing, he couldn’t shake the thought that something was deeply wrong.`

  `The lights flickered as he entered the house. His shoes echoed in the silence, a harsh reminder of how hollow it felt when he was alone. Robert sank into the couch, the envelope still burning a hole in his pocket. He pulled it out, his fingers brushing the smooth paper again before he stared at it for a moment longer than necessary. The lack of a name or a return address, the simple, almost clinical appearance—it didn’t feel right. His gut screamed that something was off, but he couldn’t quite figure out why.`

  `With a sharp exhale, he tore it open, the sound louder in the stillness than it should have been. Inside was a single sheet of paper, folded neatly. The letter itself was written in clean, precise handwriting, the kind that felt deliberate and cold.`

***`WILLIAMS,`***

***`You are known.`** `The shadows have watched. Your capabilities are not hidden from us; the immense power you carry, the unparalleled strength you possess, sets you apart.`*

*`The Global Concordat chokes this world with lies and tyranny. Its reign is built on blood, and the time for silent suffering has passed.`*

*`A new dawn demands action. You have a critical role in what is coming. The choice is stark: continue your pointless obscurity, or join us to reclaim the future.`*

*`Decide. Your answer will determine the fate of this world, and your place within it.`*

*`Meet us tomorrow. Old Train Depot. 10 PM. Alone.`***

  *`Robert’s breath hitched, a cold dread washing over him, far more potent than the night air. His mind didn't race with confusion now, but with chilling recognition. Images flashed through his memory—the impossible feats of his past, moments of brute force he’d always dismissed as adrenaline or luck, the strange, fleeting surge of power he'd only ever felt in the most desperate situations. They know. His fingers trembled violently, not with uncertainty, but with the dawning horror of being truly seen, truly exposed. He turned the paper over, expecting more, a signature, a symbol. Nothing. Just the words, burning into his mind, no longer meaningless. How in God’s name do they know about the power? And who are they?`*

  `He folded the letter back up, but his hand lingered on the paper, the weight of it pressing down on him. The words felt too heavy, like they were meant for someone else–but somehow, he knew they weren’t. He didn’t know what to make of it, but a tightness in his chest told him the answer might be closer than he wanted to admit.`

  `The night seemed colder than it should have been. The silence in the house thickened, pressing against him from all sides. He tossed the letter aside with a quick, sharp motion, the crumple of paper too loud in the stillness. His breath came in shallow bursts. It doesn’t matter, he told himself. It’s probably nothing. Someone from his past, trying to mess with him. But even as the thought passed, the words from the letter curled around his mind, cold and insistent.`

  `Robert stood up, fingers running through his hair as he tried to shake off the unease. He moved toward the bathroom, each step feeling heavier than the last. The darkness of the house seemed to close in on him like the walls themselves were waiting for something.`

  `The bathroom door creaked as he pushed it open, and the air was thick with the damp smell of old tiles and mildew. He turned the tap, letting the water run hot, steam quickly filling the room, blurring the edges of the mirrors. The hiss of water was almost soothing—almost—but it didn’t drown out the nagging sense that something was wrong.`

  `Even if the letter was real, he didn’t want to go. He didn’t want this new, quiet life with David to be disrupted. The idea of stepping back into the mess of his old world, the shadows of people he had tried to outrun, gnawed at him. He didn't want to drag someone so decent like David into the darkness he carried.`

  `He stepped into the tub, the water so hot it bit at his skin, and sank deeper into the heat, trying to drown out the thoughts that wouldn’t leave him. The steam swirled around him, clinging to his skin, but it only added to the heaviness in the air. He closed his eyes, feeling the warmth seep into his muscles, but the discomfort of the letter lingered like an aftertaste he couldn’t wash away.`

  `The letter. The invitation.`

  `What the hell was it? Why now?`

  `He let the water lap around him, his shoulders tense, the unease settling deeper into his bones. He couldn’t relax, couldn’t shake the feeling that something was waiting for him just out of sight.`
