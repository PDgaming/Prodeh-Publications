  `The park was alive with the sounds of a nice Sunday afternoon. Children’s laughter mixed with the rustling of leaves as a soft breeze carried the chirping of birds. David hadn’t planned to visit the park today, but the warm sunlight streaming through his window had coaxed him outside. Now, he wandered aimlessly, the gravel crunching under his shoes, his thoughts as scattered as the dappled sunlight on the path. He felt a quiet hum of expectation beneath his unease from yesterday, a vague hope that perhaps he might see Robert again. It was foolish, he knew, but a small part of him clung to the thought.`

  `He stopped near a wooden bench shaded by an ancient oak tree. A familiar figure sat there, hunched slightly forward, hands resting on his knees. It was Robert. David’s breath hitched in a pleasant surprise. He hadn’t truly expected it. Robert’s usual guarded expression was absent, replaced by something softer, almost counterplative, as he watched a pair of sparrows flit around a small puddle.`

  `- “Robert?” David called out, his voice tentative but warm,  trying to keep the surprise out of it.`

  `Robert looked up, surprise flickering in his eyes before he smiled faintly, a genuine softening of his features that made David’s chest feel lighter. "David. Well, isn't this something? Life has a funny way of bringing people together, doesn’t it?"`

  `David’s smile widened. He felt a wave of inexplicable relief. “Mind if I join you?” David gestured toward the empty spot on the bench.`

  `Robert nodded, shifting slightly to make room. “Go ahead. It’s a nice day, isn’t it?”`

  `- “It is,” David said, settling in. He glanced at the sparrows hopping about, and a wistful smile touched his lips as a familiar ache settled in his chest. “Eleanor… she used to love this park. She’d bring breadcrumbs to feed the birds every Sunday morning. Said it was her way of making friends. She loved simple things. The birds, the breeze, the sound of children playing. Said they reminded her that life’s beauty is always in the little moments.”`

  `He felt Robert’s gaze on him, a quiet understanding passing between them, a recognition of shared loss. David turned to him. “What about you? Do you come here often?”`

  `Robert shook his head, his gaze distant. David noticed the subtle tension in his shoulders, a slight clenching of his jaw. “Not really. I’m not much of an ‘outdoors’ person. But sometimes... sometimes I just need to get out of the house. Too many ghosts in there.”`

  `David nodded slowly, “Sometimes even the silence can be deafening.” He understood that feeling all too well.`

  `After a moment, Robert continued, his voice low and deliberate, almost a murmur against the soft park sounds. David observed the way Robert’s eyes seemed to lose focus, looking inward rather than at anything external. “I was married once. Had a family, too. A wife and a couple of kids. But I… I wasn’t a good man back then.”`

  `David’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, but he stayed silent, sensing that this was something Robert needed to share, a burden he was finally choosing to lighten, even if only a little. He felt a profound curiosity mixed with a deep, immediate empathy.`

  `- “I was in... uh.. let’s call it a ‘not so good line of work,’” Robert said, his lips curling in a self-deprecating smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. David noticed the carefully chosen words, the vagueness that hid something deeper. “Drank too much and came home angry one night, I crossed a line. Nothing irreversible, but enough to make her pack her bags. She took the kids, and that was that. Haven’t seen them in years.”`

  `The sparrows flew away as a group of joggers passed, their footsteps echoing down the path. David’s heart ached for Robert, not just for the loss of his family, but for the profound regret he could hear in Robert’s voice, the raw pain that mirrored his own. He also wondered, briefly, what kind of “line” could cause such permanent severance.`

  `- “That must’ve been hard. Losing a family… it leaves a void that's hard to fill”, David said softly, his voice gentle. “Do you… Do you ever hear from them?”`

  `Robert nodded, his eyes distant. “Hard doesn’t cover it. I’ve spent years trying to clean up my act. Got a steady job and stayed sober. But some mistakes… they don’t just go away. And now, well…” He gestured vaguely to the world around them, a heavy sigh escaping him. “It’s just me and the ghosts.”`

  `David recognized that profound sense of isolation, the feeling of being haunted by the past. It mirrored the emptiness Eleanor’s absence had left in his own life. The silence that followed felt less heavy now, more like a comfortable understanding. David watched Robert, a deep sympathy welling within him. The raw honesty in Robert’s voice was palpable, and David felt a profound connection to this man who carried such a heavy weight. He reached out and gently placed a hand on Robert’s arm, a quiet gesture of understanding. "Those ghosts… they can be persistent, but for what it’s worth, I think it’s really brave that you’re here. Trying."`

  `Robert glanced at David, surprised by the sincerity in his tone. “Thanks. That means more than you know.”`

  `The warmth of the afternoon sun soon began to fade as the sun dipped lower in the sky. The air grew a touch cooler, and the sounds of the park seemed to soften, drawing the day to a close.`

  `After a while, David shifted slightly, feeling a pleasant weariness settle over him. “It’s funny the things you find yourself thinking about when you’re just sitting here, isn’t it?” He offered a small, gentle smile, a subtle cue to shift the tone.`

  `Robert nodded slowly, a hint of a smile returning. “It is. Sometimes it’s good to just… be.”`

  `They sat in a comfortable silence, the shared weight of their unspoken experiences creating a quiet bond. The setting sun cast long shadows across the path, painting the scene in hues of orange and gold. The peaceful companionship they had found was a welcome change for Robert, David observed, a rare moment of genuine connection.`

  `Finally, Robert stood, shivering slightly, brushing off his pants, “It’s getting late. I should head back.”`

  `David stood too, smiling faintly. “Yeah, me too. This was nice, though. Talking.”`

  `- “It was,” Robert agreed, hesitating for a moment. “Maybe we could do it again sometime?”`

  `David’s smile widened. “I’d like that.”`

  `As Robert walked away, David lingered on the bench for a moment, watching him disappear down the path. Something had shifted between them—a crack in the armor, a glimpse of something raw and real. He turned toward the fading sunlight, feeling, for the first time in a long while, a flicker of hope. He still didn’t know everything about Robert’s past, but he knew enough to feel a deep empathy, and a strange, powerful pull towards this man.`
