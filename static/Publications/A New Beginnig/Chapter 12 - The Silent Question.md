  `David’s hand tightened on the doorframe, still warm from where Robert had rested his shoulder against it. He turned, looking at Robert, the questions roaring in his head. Who was that man? What "choice" was Robert being forced to make? But more terrifying than the questions was the man standing before him. David had seen a glimpse of Robert's past, a shadow of the person he had been. Tonight, he'd seen it flicker to life, a raw, protective fury in Robert's eyes, a dangerous coiled tension in his body. The gentle man I know... he was ready to kill, David thought, a cold knot forming in his stomach. The threat wasn't just on his porch anymore. It was in his home, present in the quiet stranger he loved. It had seeped into the very air, staining the comforting warmth of his living room with a chilling new reality. His world, once a tranquil haven, had just expanded to include a darkness he was utterly unprepared for, and it centered around the man who was now looking at him with such profound anxiety.`

  `- "Robert," David said quietly, his voice taut with the weight of the moment, "do you know this guy?"`

  `Robert hesitated. David watched his chest rise and fall rapidly, his eyes wide, searching David’s face. He saw the worry forming there, clear as day, a visible struggle in Robert's normally guarded gaze. The words seemed to stick in Robert's throat, each one feeling heavier than the last. Finally, he shook his head, his voice barely audible. "No."`

  `David's brow furrowed. The air between them shifted, thickening with the lie. David could see it. He could feel it. But he didn’t call him out, not yet. Instead, he pressed on, his voice low and steady. "You sure?"`

  `Robert didn’t answer. His gaze flicked toward the now-closed front door, then back to David, still filled with that raw, unspoken distress. It wasn’t fear in the traditional sense, David thought, but something deeper, something that unnerved him more.`

  `The silence stretched, filled only by the frantic thumping of David's own heart. He stepped closer, the need to understand, to break through whatever Robert was holding back, overwhelming him. "Robert, talk to me. Please."`

  `Robert’s breath caught in his throat. David watched a flicker of resignation, a profound weariness, cross his features. Robert closed his eyes for a moment, as if steeling himself, then opened them to meet David’s gaze. The guilt in them was palpable.`

  `- "I knew I shouldn’t have let it get this far," Robert muttered, the words tumbling out before he could stop them, thick with a desperation David could almost taste. He turned his head slightly, avoiding David’s direct gaze, a mixture of regret and something darker in his eyes. "I should’ve kept you at arm’s length. I never should’ve let you in."`

  `David frowned, taking a step closer, his voice firm. "You think I can’t handle it? That I don’t deserve to know what’s going on with you?"`

  `Robert winced, guilt clawing at his chest. David saw his jaw clench, a muscle working frantically. Robert's hands, which had been clenched subtly before, now trembled openly at his sides. "No, it’s not that. You don’t deserve this. You don’t deserve my past. I… I’m not the man you think I am." Robert's voice was barely a whisper, but David saw the faint sheen of tears in his eyes, the tightening of his throat. He looked utterly broken, like a man confessing the deepest shame of his life.`

  `David’s heart ached. He thought of Robert’s earlier confession in the park – the "line" he'd crossed, the family he'd lost to anger and alcohol. This, David assumed, was the core of it. Robert was haunted by the man he had been, the mistakes that had cost him his world. He was terrified that David would judge him, leave him, just as his family had. David stepped even closer until he was right in front of Robert. His gaze softened, but his voice was steady, filled with determination.`

  `- "Robert, listen to me," David said, reaching out to gently cup Robert’s face. "I trust you. I’ve trusted you from the moment I met you. You don’t have to carry this alone. I’m here for you, no matter what. Whatever mistakes you made, whatever 'line' you crossed, it’s not the man standing in front of me now. I know you've changed. You're trying. We can go through this together. You’re not alone anymore, Robert. You have me."`

  `Robert’s breath faltered as he looked into David’s eyes. The sincerity, the unwavering trust—David could see how profoundly it affected him. Robert didn't seem to have expected this kind of unconditional acceptance. And yet, David could still sense the fear clinging to him – a fear that David now mistakenly associated with the depth of Robert's past regrets about his family. Robert swallowed hard, his throat constricting, the unshed tears making his eyes glisten. He wanted to speak, to correct David's assumption, to explain the true depth of the horror that was his past, but the words faltered. The memory of the man at the door, the ominous letter, the true scale of the darkness he'd hinted at – it was too much to articulate, too much to dump on David right now.`

  `- "It’s not just the past," Robert murmured, his voice thick with unexpressed anguish. "It’s the present too. You’ve seen them—the men who follow me. They’re not just anybody. They’re part of something bigger, something I’ve been running from for some time now. But I can’t outrun it forever." He paused, swallowing hard, his gaze darting away from David’s, as if the sheer weight of the truth was too heavy to meet. "There’s a reason I’m here. But it’s not just to be with you. I can’t pretend that’s all there is."`

  `David was silent, his eyes searching Robert’s face, trying to read the storm in his expression. The men who follow him... Robert had always been so guarded, so alert. This wasn't just about a past mistake anymore. There was a current danger, a tangible threat. David took a deep, steadying breath. Finally, he spoke, his voice barely above a whisper, filled with an unshakeable resolve. "You don’t have to pretend with me. I’m here, Robert. Whatever it is, I can handle it."`

  `Robert looked down, the weight of his past crashing down on him anew, a physical burden David could almost see. The door was closed, but the storm inside him hadn’t let up. Not yet. He wasn’t ready to tell David everything, to reveal the true scale of the monster he'd been, and the dangerous world he was about to step back into. But he knew, deep down, he had to be. For both of them.`

  `- "Not yet," Robert murmured, his voice strained. "But I’ll tell you. Just not right now. I need to... I need to get my thoughts straight."`

  `The night closed in around them, the silence stretching between them, filled with things left unsaid. But one thing was certain: whatever had been set in motion, it was far from over.`
